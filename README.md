my goal: a mathematically rigourous textbook that explains basic math to children after the end of the world; no computers, limited pre-existing materials. ideally, you could leave a literate child alone with this book and they could teach themselves maths. i will be using the british version of maths as there's more than one, and many disciplines, but i will leave american spellings as i feel they are easier to sight-read.
